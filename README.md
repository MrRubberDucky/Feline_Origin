## Feline Origin for Origins mod
Welcome traveller, you probably landed here somehow so I'll explain further what this is about.

This is a **Custom Made Origin** for [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) mod.

Fun fact about this: I started working on Feline before I even noticed that Origins itself has a Feline Origin but I can guarantee you that it's nothing like that, it's something new~

## Origin Abilities
> Celestial Bond - You're **locked** to cat identity till you change your origin back to something else

> I sense everything - Activate your senses and show up to **10 entities** with your **first** ability (Usually G)

> Cat Fury - Unleash your anger against everyone with your **secondary** ability (needs to be mapped to a button of your choice) - Strenght III for 10 seconds and Hunger V for 20 seconds

> Acrobatincs - You never take **fall damage**, no matter from which height you fall

> Strong Ankles - You are able to **jump higher** by jumping **while** sprinting.

> Catlike Appearance - Creepers are **scared** of you and will only explode if you attack them first

> Sneaky - Your nameplate is **never** visible through walls, even when you're not sneaking

> Hydrophobia - You receive **damage over time** while in contact with water

> Nocturnal (Cat Vision) - You can **slightly** see in the dark when not in water

> Pescatarian - You can only eat **fish** and **sea food**

> Underground Talk - When you choose Feline Origin, you automatically join a **secret** team where you can communicate with other Felines via /teammsg

> Heart Effect - Heart Particle Effect around you!

## *Before You Begin - How to Make This Work*
If you ever ran a modpack or created one modpack then you'll know by now that you will require **Fabric Loader** to even run **Origins** and most mods that are requried here.

You'll need following mods in order to make this work: [Identity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/identity), [Origin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins), [Origins: Classes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins-classes), [MobZ](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mobz), [KubeJS Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs-fabric), [Go Fish](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/go-fish)

I'm implying you already have a minecraft instance with Fabric on it already set-up.

Click on Code button and Download Zip then open that .zip file with a archival client of your choice, I generally suggest [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) for that job but generally anything should work as long as it has ability to open and unzip.

Go to the root of your minecraft instance - usually it's just .minecraft folder and extract **KubeJS** folder there. Don't put it anywhere else, it **has** to be there. So in other words, it has to sit in the same place where **mods** folder is.

Extract **config** folder in the same place as you did with KubeJS folder previously

...and that's it. 

You're done. This long description wasn't needed but I wanted to make it 100% fool-proof. 

If you want to edit anything tag-related or recipe related, you can modify **\KubeJS\server-scripts\script.js**, it generally has a lot of information there in case you want to change anything.
